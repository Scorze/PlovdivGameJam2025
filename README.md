## Installation

This project was developed in Unity 2023.2 URP.

To dive into the Multiplayer Kart Racer game development series, initiate your own URP project in Unity and folow along with the tutorial videos. This repository stands as a reference for those who find themselves in a fix or identify discrepancies in the video recordings. After setting up your project, don't forget to install the dependencies highlighted above.

The included Unity package contains a Kart prefab with all the models, meshes and materials - but no scripts! Import it if you aren't cloning the repository or just want to skip over the ProBuilder section of the video. Everything contained in that package is also in the repository.
